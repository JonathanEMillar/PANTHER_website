    "text": "How to propose an intervention for PANTHER\n\nWe welcome proposals from academic and industry partners. Proposals may be for re-purposed drugs or assets suitable for phase II study in our target population.\nTo assist with the process, we ask those wishing to propose an intervention to complete a standardised summary for the drug. This requests information on the evidence for efficacy, safety, and pharmacology, along with data required to judge the feasibility of including the intervention in the platform.\nInformal, pre-submission enquiries can be made to Dr Jonathan Millar (jonathan.millar@ed.ac.uk) or Prof Danny McAuley (d.f.mcauley@qub.ac.uk).\nComplete proposals will first be considered by the PANTHER intervention selection committee. Interventions will be assessed against a pre-defined criteria.\nBased on these criteria and the available evidence, this committee will then make recommendations to an independent intervention committee. The independent committee will advise the trial management group, who will make the final decision about inclusion into the platform.\nThe Trial Steering Committee and Data Monitoring Committee will be informed of the plan to introduce a new intervention prior to the commencement of the intervention.\nIt is anticipated that new interventions will join the platform at intervals, as others graduate or end. Over time, the evidence supporting interventions is likely to evolve. Therefore, interventions deemed to have insufficient support at the time of assessment will continue to be periodically reconsidered.\nA list of these can be viewed here.\n\nDownload a template for proposing an intervention.\nCompleted proposals should be addressed to jonathan.millar@ed.ac.uk"
